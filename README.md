Bandito Racing

A small racetrack where you could race with rcbanditos, located at: **-920.9135, -724.4799, 19.9719, 170.8050**
originally made for my own server, STRPWFL Roleplay (You can change the texture to your server logo or something else!). All files are accessible ofcourse.

**INSTALLATION:** Just drag and drop the "knjgh_banditoracing" folder into your FiveM [Resources] and make sure to add "ensure knjgh_banditoracing" to your server.cfg
